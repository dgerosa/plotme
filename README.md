#### Things I like in Python

`skywalker` is a Python module which contains some of the things I like in python. I was tired of copying the same snippets over and over, so I put them in a module to be imported from everywhere. `skywalker` is compatible with both python 2 and 3, and deals with all sort of things like plotting, timing, checkpointing, etc. etc. A list of all functions and tools is available in the documentation.

## Installation

    pip install skywalker
